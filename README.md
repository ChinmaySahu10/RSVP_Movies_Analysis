### Problem Statement
The objective is to equip the production company with the necessary insights to shape a successful and data-driven approach for their global movie release in 2023. 

### Business Goal
The primary business goal for RSVP Movies in this project is to strategically plan and execute the upcoming global movie release in 2023. Specifically, the production company aims to leverage data-driven insights derived from the analysis of the past three years' movie releases.The business goals can be summarized as follows:

1) **Informed Decision-Making**: Utilize data analytics to make informed decisions for the global audience project, ensuring strategic planning and execution.

1) **Global Audience Success**: Derive insights that contribute to the success of the movie release on a global scale, catering to diverse audience preferences.

1) **Optimized Production Strategies**: Identify patterns and trends in past movie data to optimize production strategies, including content, marketing, and distribution.

1) **Maximized ROI**: Ensure that resources are allocated efficiently by making decisions that maximize return on investment (ROI) for the global project.

1) **Competitive Edge**: Gain a competitive edge in the international film market by tailoring strategies based on data-driven insights.

By achieving these business objectives, RSVP Movies aims to position itself for success in the global cinema landscape and enhance its reputation as a producer of blockbuster movies.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information from past 3 years i.e. 2019 to 2022 about directors, movies, names, rating for each movies & actors. Also it includes the genre & roles of each film.

## Approach
The approach for this project was carried out in a systematic and structured process to ensure effective analysis and meaningful insights. Here's a detailed description:

1) **Understand Business Objectives**:

- Gaining a deep understanding of RSVP Movies' goals for the global movie release.
- identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) and success criteria.

1) **Data Exploration**:

- Familiarizing myself with the dataset provided, understanding the structure and contents.
- identifying relevant tables and fields for analysis.

1) **Segmented Analysis** (this was already provided with question script):

- Divide the analysis into the four specified segments, addressing each set of questions separately.
- Prioritize segments based on their impact on key business objectives.

1) **SQL Query Development**:

- Developing SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data for each segment.
- Ensureing queries align with business questions and provide actionable insights.

1) **Pattern Identification**:

- Identify patterns, trends, and correlations within the data to derive meaningful insights.
- Keeping an eye on outliers or anomalies that may impact decision-making.

1) **Insightful Recommendations**:

- Translating the analytical findings into actionable recommendations for RSVP Movies.
- Articulating how the insights can inform strategic decisions for the global release.

1) **Documentation and Reporting**:

- Documenting the SQL script file containing solutions for each segment.
- Generating a comprehensive report summarizing insights, recommendations, and the analytical process.

1) **Submission and Presentation**:

- Submit the SQL script file and the comprehensive report as per project requirements.

By adhering to this structured approach, the data analysis was carried out to ensure a thorough and insightful analysis that directly addresses RSVP Movies' business objectives for the global movie release. 

### Results and Conclusions
The logistic regression model demonstrates strong predictive performance in identifying leads with a higher likelihood of conversion. The top features contributing to lead conversion include `Total Time Spent on Website`, `Lead Source_Welingak website`, `Lead Source_Reference`, `Last Activity_Email Opened`, and `Last Activity_SMS Sent`.

The insights gained from this analysis can guide the company's lead management strategy by focusing on leads with higher predicted conversion probabilities. This targeted approach can lead to increased conversion rates, efficient resource allocation, and improved overall sales performance.
