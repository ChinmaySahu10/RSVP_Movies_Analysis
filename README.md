### Results and Conclusions
Based on the analysis of a movie dataset, several insights and recommendations have been derived for RSVP. The analysis reveals that the number of movies produced over the years has been declining, with March being the month with the highest number of movie releases and December being the lowest. The dataset comprises `39 unique genres`, with `drama being the most popular genre`, consisting of `4285 movies` with an `average duration of 106.77 minutes`. Therefore, the report suggests that RSVP should `focus on drama genre movies for their future films`, although action and thriller genres can also be explored.
The analysis also indicates that `Dream Warrior Pictures and National Theatre Live are the top production companies`, producing the highest number of hit movies among all production companies. The `top three directors` in the top three genres, namely `James Mahgold, Soubin Shahir, Joe Russo, and Anthony Russo`, can be selected for RSVP's next project. Moreover, the actors `Mammootty and/or Mohanlal can be hired based on median rating`.
Lastly, the report suggests that RSVP can `collaborate with Marvel Studios, Twentieth Century Fox, and Warner Bros`, the top three production houses, based on the number of votes received by their movies. The top actor in the dataset is `Vijay Sethupathi, while Taapsee Pannu is the top actress based on average ratings`. These insights and recommendations can assist RSVP in making data-driven decisions to improve their future movie projects.

The insights gained from this analysis can guide the company's lead management strategy by focusing on leads with higher predicted conversion probabilities. This targeted approach can lead to increased conversion rates, efficient resource allocation, and improved overall sales performance.
